## Clayton Mercer

I worked as a software engineering intern at LifeOmic during this summer. The technologies I used were React, React Native, and NodeJS as well as many AWS products. Most of the remainder of the summer was time spent with family. It all went very well considering COVID so I can't complain. 

## Ryan Slack

I took two online classes at BSU over the summer (Web Programming and Android development), which I thoroughly enjoyed. I learned PHP, html, CSS, javascript, and jquery, and built mobile apps using Java and Gradle in Android Studio. I also spent a week in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, mostly sightseeing and trying different restaurants. It was fun. Outside of that, I spent time with family and attended the wedding of my younger sister who got married in late August. It was a good time.


## Daniel Litt

I spent the summer working for a small startup where I developed for unity with C#. I briefly visited Florida to visit family. I also spent some time and taught myself react I created a small still unfinished app using the framework.

## Andrew Thomas

I took two online classes as well and worked full time as a solutions architect at Solutions4ebiz. I wrote shell scripts to migrate sites to newer server. I refactored a 20-year old e-commerce site to run on the latest software, and integrated a new payment processor to maintain PCI compliance. I built a few custom sites using Laravel. One was a custom survey site for a church to see their members gifts, and another managed invoices for a major VoIP company. I automated the throttling of internet speeds based on payment statuses and dynamically adjusted customer's tv access based on the plan they payed for. I did various other tasks as needed.

## Chunxiang Yu

This summer, I stayed in Muncie and took an online course at Ball State University. I took a total of 4 courses in the summer. They are CS 110, CS 419, CS 445 and HIST 150. CS 419 and CS 445 have helped me the most. On CS 419, I mainly learn to use the lunix system and try to program in the command line. In addition, I also learned basic knowledge about threads, processes, and operating systems. This helps me a lot in understanding the operation of the computer system. On CS 445, I mainly studied the design of the user interface and the connection between the database and the front end. I used C#, CSS, and JavaScript to create a pizza restaurant ordering webpage. This webpage can realize the user registration, login, select pizza size, fill in the delivery address and other functions.


## Jacob Davis

Over the summer i spent most of it at home contributing to open source projects especially a lot of client extensions like facecheck for League of Legends. I even spent time helping with other web apps that are open to contribution.
