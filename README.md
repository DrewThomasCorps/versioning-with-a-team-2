## Clayton Mercer

I worked as a software engineering intern at LifeOmic during this summer. The technologies I used were React, React Native, and NodeJS as well as many AWS products. Most of the remainder of the summer was time spent with family. It all went very well considering COVID so I can't complain.

I took two online classes at BSU over the summer (Web Programming and Android development), which I thoroughly enjoyed. I learned PHP, html, CSS, javascript, and jquery, and built mobile apps using Java and Gradle in Android Studio. I also spent a week in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, mostly sightseeing and trying different restaurants. It was fun. Outside of that, I spent time with family and attended the wedding of my younger sister who got married in late August. It was a good time.
